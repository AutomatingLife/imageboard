						| This is an anonymous imageboard, a discussion board/BBS where users share text or images about various topics. 
					p
						| The most notable feature of imageboards and primary difference to traditional forums is 
						| that anybody can make a post without the need to register an account or provide 
						| any personal information. This way, what is said becomes more important than who says it.
						| As new threads are started, the least recently replied to are pruned. This creates an 
						| element of transience and keeps making room for new content.
