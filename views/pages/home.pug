						| This is an anonymous imageboard, a type of discussion board where users share images and text about various topics. 
					p
						| The primary difference to traditional forums is that anybody can make a post without the need to register an account or provide 
						| any personal information. This lowers the barrier to entry and allows users to remain anonymous. This is especially important 
						| when discussing topics that could have consequences if the posters identity was revealed, for example political persecution.
