update globalmanagesettings model
update globalmanagesettings controller
update global manage settings pug template (idea: show names of perm levels)
update paramconverter for mass of new number/trim/array fields, etc for the form

^^^ ok this is so fucking annoying, the controllers need refactoring. so im gonna make some generic handler for that, maybe it could even be made to a module

---

uhhh, need to make the defaults built into the db, i guess part of gulp reset,
AND a migration for existing sites to import from configs/main (since the options structure not changing yet)

go through every import/require of configs/main and replace with getconfig and destructures of the return

call gulp tasks for images, captcha, css, html, (e.g. change captcha type, clear html) etc from within chan or build-worker probs build worker

need to add update method to commit config and make it a getter, as hash could change

add getConfig calls for perms level in route middlewares

ability to update extra mime tyrpes, need access to add then filter  other mimetypes set

make perm levels everywhere into an enum (if they dont exist just freeze an object)

ability to reload themes, add some init() method so it can just be called again

allow updates to renderLocals in helpers.render for captchatype, some method to update locals from getConfig or whatever it will be called. same as a few other places
