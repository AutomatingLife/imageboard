update global manage settings pug template (idea: show names of perm levels)

---

callback for perms level check to delete board

call gulp tasks for images, captcha, css, html, (e.g. change captcha type, clear html) etc from within chan or build-worker probs build worker. in the globalmanagesettings model? actually DUH just make the gulp tasks exported as a map then pass a build task with task name

uhhh, need to make the defaults built into the db, i guess part of gulp reset,
AND a migration for existing sites to import from configs/main (since the options structure not changing yet)

set max, min, maxlength, etc in views/pages/globalmanagesettings

make perm levels everywhere into an enum (if they dont exist just freeze an object)

proper validation for dnsbl URL/ips

proper validation for extra mimetypes < probably kinda important

refactor every controller to the new format.. holy FUCK
